title: M3U8 - Tool to download split-up online video streams
---
So, a bit ago I found a neat little tool that allows you to download split-up video streams. Usually, you'd have to download each 2 minute section of, let's say, a 90 minute movie by yourself, and that'd be pretty meh. 
Well, these guys here (https://tajaribsoft-en.blogspot.com) created "M3U8", which really is an amazingly simple solution to this problem.
